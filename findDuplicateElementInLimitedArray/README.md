**Find duplicate element in a limited range array**

Given a limited range array of size n where array contains elements between 1 to n-1 with one element repeating, find the duplicate number in it.


For example,

**Input:**  
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4]  

**Output:**  
Duplicate is 4

**Solution:**  
The time complexity of above solution is _O(n)_ and auxiliary space used by the program is _O(1)_.

Find sum of all element and find difference between it and all elements which are supposed to be there.
