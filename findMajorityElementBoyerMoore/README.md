**Find majority element (Boyer–Moore Majority Vote Algorithm)**

Given an array of integers containing duplicates, return the majority element in an array if present. 
A majority element appears more than n/2 times where n is the size of the array.


For example,

**Input:**  
arr = [2, 8, 7, 2, 2, 5, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2]  

**Output:**  
2

**Solution:** 

We can find the majority element using linear time and constant space using Boyer–Moore majority vote algorithm 

_O(n) complexity and O(1) space ._
