**Find Longest Bitonic Subarray in an array**

The longest bitonic subarray problem is to find a subarray of a given sequence in which the subarrayâ€™s elements are first sorted in in increasing order, then in decreasing order, and the subarray is as long as possible. Strictly ascending or descending subarrays are also accepted.


For example,

**Input:**  
arr = [3, 5, 8, 4, 5, 9, 10, 8, 5, 3, 4]  

**Output:**  
[4, 5, 9, 10, 8, 5, 3 ]

**Solution:** 

We can solve this problem without using extra space. The idea is to check for longest bitonic subarray starting at A[i]. If longest bitonic subarray starting at A[i] ends at A[j], the trick is to skip all elements between i and j as longest bitonic subarray starting from them will have less length. So, next we check for longest bitonic subarray starting at A[j]. We continue this process till end of array is reached and also keep track of longest bitonic subarray found so far.

The time complexity of above solution is _O(n)_ and auxiliary space used by the program is _O(1)_.
