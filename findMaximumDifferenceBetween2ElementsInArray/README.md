**Find maximum difference between two elements in an array by satisfying given constraints**

Given an array of integers, find the maximum difference between two elements in the array such that smaller element appears before the larger element.


For example,

**Input:**  
arr = [2, 7, 9, 5, 1, 3, 5]  

**Output:**  
(2, 9)

**Solution:** 
_O(n) complexity and O(1) space ._
